SITE TO SITE VPN LAB {we need two subscription for this lab that means two accounts (I have mine and Mihir's account)}

{In this lab East US location is not in the same subscription as Central US but in another Location}

For simplicity {
 mine account (A) : here I will create virtual network of Central US location

  Mihir's account(B) : here I will create virtual network of East US location
}



{connecting two different clouds . here we will have both the locations in different clouds or subscriptions}


step 1  - to configure, first create another resource group 'centralusrg_lab2' virtual network 'centralusvnet'
and subnet 'frontend' but change the location to central US (through Account A)

Subscription    ----  Azure for Students
Resource group  ----  centralusrg_lab2
Name            ----  centralvnet
Region          ----  Central US
Address space   ----  10.3.0.0/24
Subnet          ----  frontend (10.3.0.0/26)

create another subnet in 'centralvnet' 

 Name :  backend
 Subnet address range  : 10.3.0.64/26

create another resource group 'eastusrg_lab2' virtual network 'eastusvnet'
and subnet 'frontend' but change the location to East US (through Account B)

Subscription    ----  Azure for Students
Resource group  ----  eastusrg_lab2
Name            ----  eastvnet
Region          ----  East US
Address space   ----  10.0.0.0/24
Subnet          ----  frontend (10.0.0.0/26)

create another subnet in 'eastvnet' 

 Name :  backend
 Subnet address range  : 10.0.0.64/26

step 2 - create a gateway subnet in 'centralusvnet' (through Account A)

  Name                          : GatewaySubnet
  Subnet address range		: 10.3.0.128/28	

  create a gateway subnet in 'eastusvnet' (through Account B)
  
  Name                          : GatewaySubnet
  Subnet address range		: 10.0.0.128/28

step 3 - Create public IP for specific locations and these public IPs will be used by Virtual Network Gateway

  For Central US (through Account A)

       public IP name :          centraluspip                   |
       SKU  :                    Basic                          |
       IP address assignment :   Dynamic                        |
       Resource group (change):  centralusrg_lab2		|  created public ip in central us (through Account A)  
       Location :		 central US			|
   

  For East US (through Account B)	

       public IP name :          eastuspip                      |
       SKU  :                    Basic                          |
       IP address assignment :   Dynamic                        |
       Resource group (change):  eastusrg_lab2 			|  created public ip in east us (through Account B)
       Location :		 East US			|

step 4 - creating virtual network gateways for both locations Cental US and East US

      Name :                     ceantralusvnetgw               |
      SKU  :                     Basic                          |
      Resource group (change):   centralusrg_lab2		|  central us virtual network gateways (through Account A)
      Virtual network :          centralusvnet			|
      Public IP address  :       {use existing} centraluspip	|
      Gateway type       :       VPN                            |
      subnet             :       GatewaySubnet (10.3.0.128/28)  |

      Name :                     eastusvnetgw                   |
      SKU  :                     Basic                          |
      Resource group (change):   eastusrg_lab2			|  east us virtual network gateways (through Account B)
      Virtual network :          eastusvnet			|
      Public IP address  :       {use existing} eastuspip	|
      Gateway type       :       VPN                            |
      subnet             :       GatewaySubnet (10.0.0.128/28)  |

step 5 - Create virtual machine for both location Cental US and East US

      Resource group :           centralusrg_lab2		|
      Virtual machine name:      centralusvm			|
      Region :                   Central US			|
      Image  :                   Windows Server 2016 Datacenter	|
      Username:                  centralus_usr			|
      password:                  Manoj@1234567			|  vertual machine in Central US location
      Public inbound ports:      None   { Allow all the ports}	|
      virtual network    :       centralusvnet			|
      subnet     :               frontend (10.3.0.0/26)	        |
      public ip  :               centralusvm-ip			|
      Public IP address :        168.61.154.8			|
      Private IP address :       10.3.0.4			|

    {In subnet you can select backend also}

      Resource group :           eastusrg_lab2			|
      Virtual machine name:      eastusvm			|
      Region :                   East US			|
      Image  :                   Windows Server 2016 Datacenter	|
      Username:                  eastus_usr			|
      password:                  Manoj@1234567			|  vertual machine in East US location
      Public inbound ports:      None   { Allow all the ports}	|
      virtual network    :       eastusvnet			|
      subnet     :               frontend (10.0.0.0/26)		|
      public ip  :               eastusvm-ip			|
      Public IP address :        40.114.115.159			|
      Private IP address :       10.0.0.4			|

   {In subnet you can select backend also}

   {Vm cost is different in different location}



step 6 - while creating the VM we had not allowed RDP so if you try to connect with through your personal computer RDP it will not connect.So first allow RDP ports for 
Central US location and East US location.

 Go to respective VMs {'centralusvm' in 'centralusrg_lab2' and  'eastusvm' in 'eastusrg_lab2' } and then to networking option {creating security rule }

    click 'Add inbound port rule'

    Destination port ranges : * {any}
    Name : Port_Any

    {It allows port for RDP as well as ICMPv4 }

step 7 - connect to centralusvm {Central US (through Account A)} and eastusvm {East US (through Account B)}
         
         i) go to 'windows fireball advanced security' then go to 'File and printer sharing(Echo Request)'{choose the first one} and enable it if it is disabled. If it is disabled in eastusvm then centralusvm will not be able to connect and if it is disabled in centralusvm then eastusvm will not be able to connect.{Request ICMPv4}

          {if not connected it shows 'time out'}

         ii)open command promt in both VMs in normal mode { no administrator mode }
         iii) ping public ip in both for each other
            example : in centralusvm prompt type --> ping 104.45.146.230 {public ip of eastusvm}
                      in eastusvm prompt type --> ping 52.165.34.25 {public ip of centralusvm}

	

step 8 - Create a local network gateway {In site-to-site the change that we need to create a local network gateway for both locations}


	i)If we try to connect VMs through private ips by typing commands in centralusvm prompt ---> ping 10.0.0.4 -t {private ip of eastusvm } 
        and 
          typing commands in eastusvm prompt ----> ping 10.3.0.4 -t {private ip of centralusvm}
        
        then you will get 'time out' that means they are not connected
         ii)to sort out this problem . go to 'virtual network gateway' and select 'ceantralusvnetgw' then click 'connections' , select 'connection type' Site-to-Site and             create a local network gateway.

           In centrlusvnetgw create a local network gateway
				
				Name 		: 	eastuslngw
                                IP address 	:	40.87.0.102 (public IP address of eastuspip) // because you want to connect to eastusvnet
				Address space 	:	10.0.0.0/24 // address space of 'eastusvnet'
	   
	   In eastusvnetgw create a local network gateway
				
				Name 		: 	centraluslngw
                                IP address 	:	104.43.209.230 (public IP address of eastuspip) // because you want to connect to centralusvnet
				Address space 	:	10.3.0.0/24 // address space of 'centralusvnet'

          
           
	iii)and then 'add'  and name it 'centralus-to-eastus' repeat the same for 'eastusvnetgw'.
              

			Name :                 			centralus-to-eastus	|
			connection type :      			Site-to-Site		|
                        First virtual network gateway :		ceantralusvnetgw	|    for ceantralusvnetgw
			Local network gateway :			eastuslngw		|
			Shared key (PSK):			abc123			|
			resource group:				centralusrg_lab2	|
 			Location:				Central US		|

			Name :                 			eastus-to-centralus	|
			connection type :      			Site-to-Site		|
                        First virtual network gateway :		eastusvnetgw		|    for eastusvnetgw
			Local network gateway :			centraluslngw		|
			Shared key (PSK):			abc123			|
			resource group:				eastusrg_lab2		|
                        Location:				East US			|
		
          {shared key should be same in both}



Keep the VMs running Now we will see now connect our personl laptop with one of those VMs that means point to site connection


POINT-TO-SITE connection-------------

{we will use central us loction for this . You can use east US location also}

if you now type in command prompt of  our personl laptop --> ping 52.165.34.25  {public ip of centralusvm} . It will connect .

BUT

if you now type in command prompt of  our personl laptop --> ping 10.3.0.4 -t {private ip of centralusvm} .you wont be able to connect.For this we need certificate 'root' certificate and 'client' certificate for  VPN.

Step 1 - Open windows powershell ISE of your personal laptop and type the following commands

{{{{First type these below 4 lines in script then run all four at once by pressing 'run selection (F8)'. First 4 lines are to create root certificate}}}}}

$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature `
-Subject "CN=P2SRootCert" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `
-HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `
-CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsageProperty Sign -KeyUsage CertSign

{{{{Then type these below 4 lines in script then run all four at once by pressing 'run selection (F8)'.These 4 lines are to create Child certificate}}}}}

New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature `
-Subject "CN=P2SChildCert" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable `       
-HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 `
-CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" `
-Signer $cert -TextExtension @("2.5.29.37={text}1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2")


{You can give your desired name in CN="....." . Here 'P2S' means point to site }

step 2 - Go to start button and search 'certmgr.msc' select it. See that in '\Personal\certificate' your certificate has been created.

step 3 - Export the 'P2SRootCert' 

      Select - No, do not export the private key
      select - Base 64 encoded X.509 (.cert)
      select - location where you want to export .{ My file name is 'root.cer' and it is in 'Azure' folder in 'site_to_site_vpn_lab'}


      Similarily Export the 'P2SChildCert'

      Select - Yse,export the private key 
      select - personal information exchange
      give a password - Manoj@123
      Encrption - TripleDes SHA1
      select - location where you want to export .{ My file name is 'child.pfx' and it is in 'Azure' folder in 'site_to_site_vpn_lab'}

Step 4 - open 'root.cer' file with Notepad and copy the certificate text.

Step 5 - Go to 'centralusvnetgw' and then to 'Point-to-site configuration' and then click 'Configure now' 
    
       i) type in your command prompt ---> config/all
       ii) My IPv4 address is - 192.168.29.36
       iii) Address pool 		: 	192.168.29.0/24  {My laptop IP address space}
 	    Nmae			:       root
            Public certificate data	:       copy the 'root.cer' text here
 
          After saving , download the VPN client

        download the centralusvnetgw.zip
       
       i)open WindowsAmd64 
       ii) setup the VPNClientSetupAMD64.exe
       iii)Go to VPN settings in your laptop . There you will find out 'centralusvnet' . Connect it

       iv) ALL SET !!! Now go to command promt of your laptop and tpye ping 10.3.0.4 -t {private ip of centralusvm} .It will connect . HURRY!!!!

            
 Earlier we Used public Address IP of VM in RDP connection of our laptop to connect with VM but now we can also use private Address IP of VM in  RDP connection to connect with our laptop . This is because we have Are using VPN (Virtual private network). 

  In the 'centralusvnetgw | Point-to-site configuration' under Allocated IP addresses you will find your IPv4 Address : 192.168.29.3



(For cost reducion I have deleted the VMs centrausvm and eastusvm along with their disks)
